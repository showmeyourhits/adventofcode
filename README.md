# Solutions for Advent of Code
## day 1

Heap can be used in part two, but on this scale - `.sort()` will do.

## day 2

Should create more sofisticated Rock Paper Scissors algorithm - but series of `if` & `switches` works just fine.

## day 3

Comparison of Sets.

## day 4

Read pairs by line and compare borders.

## day 5

Create Stack class, that will handle stacks state and accepts commands.
First parse the Stack state, then read commands line by line.

## day 6 

Create a "sliding window" to iterate over string. On each iteration create a Set and check it's length.
